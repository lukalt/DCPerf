# WDLBench

This is a benchmark that covers many widely distributed libraries and functions, which consume a considerable amount of CPU cycles in the datacenter.



## Usage
WDLBench and its job information are located in separate files. To use it (install, run, list, etc.), please **always** specify the path:
```
./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl install|run|list|others ...
```


## Install WDLBench

```
./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl install folly_single_core
```

## Run WDLBench
As of 2025 Q3, we have the following libraries included -- `folly`, `lzbench`, `openssl`, and `vdso_bench`,
each can run on a single core or all cores.

for `folly`, the user can choose to run them all together (i.e., run all microbenchmarks with one DCPerf run) or individually (i.e., one microbenchmark per DCPerf run) with different jobs.
```
./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl run folly_single_core|folly_all_core|folly_multi_thread

./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl run folly_individual -i '{"name": "function_name"}'
```
for list of functions to run then individually, see [list of benchmarks in folly](#list-of-benchmarks-in-folly).

For `lzbench`, `openssl` and `vdso_bench`, the user can pass parameters to select how to run them.
```
./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl run lzbench -i '{"type": "single_core|all_core"}'

./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl run openssl -i '{"type": "single_core|all_core"}'

./benchpress_cli.py  -b wdl run vdso_bench -i '{"type": "single_core|multi_thread"}'
```
For `lzbench` and `openssl`, the user can also pass the `algo` parameter to specify the algorithm used, for `lzbench`, the default algorithm is `zstd`, while for `openssl`, the default algorithm is `ctr` (`aes-256-ctr`).

## Reporting and Measurement
For now, for each benchmark, we report the results in the `out_name.json` file in `benchmark_metrics_<uuid>` folder. In the JSON file,
the keys are the items run in the benchmark, and the values are the corresponding performance
numbers (typically throughput (iterations per second)).

In future, we plan to add reference performance numbers of each benchmark as baseline, and DCPerf
can automatically compare the performance of your run against the default reference run.
